I have simulated the simplified trusted node classically using numpy. Currently working implementing with actual qubits in qiskit and advancing the research cited above through partial error correction of STN Links. Check out Simulation/CascadeSTN.py to see the the full implementation of the simulation including error correction with the cascade algorithm. I am sorry for less documentation since I am going to format the entire repo at the end of this project. Thanks so much for looking at my repo!
